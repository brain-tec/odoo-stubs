> including classes, variables, functions â€“ and most importantly, their types.

By using these stubs, IDEs will provide better code completion,
and static type checkers will provide better reports.
These stubs should be used in conjunction with:
- [PyCharm plugin for Odoo](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13499-odoo)
- [Visual Studio Code extension for Odoo](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trinhanhngoc.vscode-odoo)

## Usage

### 1. Clone the branch corresponding to the Odoo version

Example, for Odoo 16:
```
git clone -b 16.0 https://github.com/odoo-ide/odoo-stubs.git odoo-stubs16
```

### 2. Configure IDEs

#### PyCharm

First make sure you have attached the [Odoo source code](https://github.com/odoo/odoo)
to your project.
Then open `Settings > Project > Project Structure`,
select the project containing the Odoo source code and click `Add Content Root` to add the odoo-stubs folder.

#### Visual Studio Code

Create [`pyrightconfig.json`](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/configuration) in the Odoo source code folder
(should be the root folder of your workspace) with something like the following example:

```json
{
    "stubPath": "path/to/odoo-stubs"
}
```
